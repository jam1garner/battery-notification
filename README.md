# battery-notification

Every other low battery icon, notification, etc. in the world doesn't not work for my brain.
This one gives a small out of the way notification once a minute so I can't just say "oh one more minute", immediately
forget and then let my battery drain until I'm greeted with a black screen. So if you need a battery notification that
will annoy you less than the windows in-your-face popup while still actually getting the job done, this might work for you,
no clue.

## Install

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/jam1garner/battery-notification
```

Then setup, in your platform specific way, a means of having this launch in the background on boot.
